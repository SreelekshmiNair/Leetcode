The DepFs function is a recursive helper function that counts the fish in the connected region starting from the cell (x, y).
It marks cells as visited and sums the number of fish in the current cell, then recursively explores its four neighbors (up, down, left, right).
It stops when it encounters out-of-bounds cells, already visited cells, or empty cells (grid[x][y] == 0) which are the land cells.

The outer loop iterates through all the grid cells.
For each unvisited cell that contains fish (grid[i][j] != 0), it starts a DFS to count the fish in the connected region and updates maxFish to track the largest fish count found.


Time Complexity:
O(m * n): Each cell is visited once by DFS.
Space Complexity:
O(m * n): For the visited array and the recursion stack.
